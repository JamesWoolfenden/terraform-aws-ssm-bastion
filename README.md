Build Harness [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/JamesWoolfenden/build-harness.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/JamesWoolfenden/build-harness) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/JamesWoolfenden/build-harness.svg)](https://github.com/JamesWoolfenden/build-harness/releases/latest)


This `build-harness` is a collection of Makefiles to facilitate building Golang projects, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, and more.
It's designed to work with CI/CD systems such as Travis CI, CircleCI and Jenkins.

---

This project uses the "build-harness" a modified version of the project ["SweetOps"](https://cpco.io/sweetops) from Cloudposse. Sweet indeed.


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).

## Introduction

Some text here


## Usage

At the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...
```make
-include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JamesWoolfenden/build-harness/master/templates/Makefile.build-harness"; echo .build-harness)
```
This will download a `Makefile` called `.build-harness` and include it at run-time. We recommend adding the `.build-harness` file to your `.gitignore`.
This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.
Run `make help` for a list of available targets.
**NOTE:** the `/` is interchangable with the `:` in target names

## Quick Start

Here's how to get started...
1. `git clone https://github.com/jameswoolfenden/build-harness.git` to pull down the repository
2. `make init` to initialize the [`build-harness`](https://github.com/jameswoolfenden/build-harness/)



## Examples

Here are some real world examples:
- [`github-authorized-keys`](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-authorized-keys/) - A Golang project that leverages `docker/%`, `go/%`, `travis/%` targets
- [`charts`](https://github.com/cloudposse/charts/) - A collection of Helm Charts that leverages `docker/%` and `helm/%` targets
- [`bastion`](https://github.com/cloudposse/bastion/) - A docker image that leverages `docker/%` and `bash/lint` targets
- [`terraform-null-label`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/) - A terraform module that leverages `terraform/%` targets



## Makefile Targets
